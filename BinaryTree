BINARY TREE
-----------


A binary tree is composed of nodes connected by edges. Some binary tree, t, is either empty or consists of a single root element with two distinct binary tree child elements known as the left subtree and the right subtree of t.


The following diagram depicts two different binary trees:

Here are the basic facts and terms to know about binary trees

-->The convention for binary tree diagrams is that the root is at the top and subtrees branch down from it.

-->A node's left and right subtrees are referred to as children and that node can be referred to as the parent of those subtrees

--> A non-root node with no children is called a leaf

--> A node A can be ancestor of some node B if B is located in a left or a right subtree whose root node is A. This means that the root node of  a binary tree is ancestor of all other nodes.

--> The depth/level of a node is the distance from the node to its root node, where the distance is number of edges.

--> A non-root node with no children is called a leaf

--> Simply put the height of a tree is the number of edges(distance) from the root node to the leaf.


Let's apply some of the terms we learned above to the binary tree shown above:

--> The root node is A

--> The respective left and right children of A are B and E. The left child of B is C. The left and right children of E are F and D.

--> Nodes C, F and D are leaves

--> The A(root node) is the ancestor of all other nodes. B is the ancestor of C, E is the ancestor of F and D,

--> The depth of node A is 1, The depth of nodes B, E is 2. The depth of c, F, D nodes is 3.

--> The height of tree is 2

A Binary Search tree(BST) is either empty or satisfies the following 3 conditions:

--> Each element on the left subtree is less than or equal to the root element.

--> Each element on the right subtree is greater than the root element.

--> Both left tree and right tree are BSTs.

The above points are demonstrated in the above digram.
