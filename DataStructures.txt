DATA STRUCTURES
---------------

From edx IIT Bombay
-------------------

--> Datatypes are equivalent to DataStructures. Example int can also be called as DataStructure

--> So it is important to note how much of memory do each data structure holds. The memory allocations are as follows;

 => signed char = 1 byte
 => int = 2 / 4 bytes
 => unsigned int = 2 / 4 bytes 
 => short = 2 bytes

Let's adding two integers with a above the range of extremities are impossible to perform.


The above stated built-in datatypes can also be termed as built in datastructures


VARIABLE AND CLASS
-----------------

A variable is a value type and a class is a reference type just like pointer.

Therefore a class stores the reference in form of heap. Value type is stack. Which means object declared lives in form of heap and value type in form of stack.

	Specifically calling the variable loads entire stack whereas loadig a object by default loads null reference, and if a reference exists it references to the address to the memory of heap
